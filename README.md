## AnyMOD

[AnyMOD.jl](https://github.com/leonardgoeke/AnyMOD.jl) is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) framework for creating large scale energy system models with multiple periods of capacity expansion formulated as linear optimization problems. It was developed to address the challenges in modelling high-levels of intermittent generation and sectoral integration. A comprehensive description of the framework's graph based methodology can found in the working paper [Göke (2020), AnyMOD - A graph-based framework for energy system modelling with high levels of renewables and sector integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10184). The software itself is seperately introduced in [Göke (2020), AnyMOD.jl: A Julia package for creating energy system models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00895).
